Common Mistakes

home page is always called index.html
use lowercase for everything
folder should be called hw0, hw1, hw2...
use only one stylesheet for small sites like these
follow convention!

dont use <font> in html, thats what css is for
you can't use '<' or '>' as text, replace with &lt; and &gt; ("html entities")

ways to select elements:
	by tag name ==>name
	by class ==> .name
	by ID ==> #name
		-like class only this can be applied to only one element
		-an element can only have one ID
		-kinda discouraged, not reusable

css syntax:
	p{ //called the selector
		font-size: 18px;   //definition block
		color: blue;	   //property
						   //value
	}	

common styles:
	color/background-color
	text-decoration (none/underline)
	width/height/font-size (percentage or pixel value)
	border (size style color e.g. border: 1px double red;)

box model:
	margin //how far things need to stay away from the border
	border //visual border
	padding //distance between border and content within
	content/height-width

CSS display:
	display: block; ==> element takes up the full available width, starts on a new line
	display: inline; ==> element takes up only the width of its content, no new line
	display: none; ==> not rendered in browser, does not affect the positioning of anything else
	display: inline-block; ==> only needed width like inline, but we can set height, width, 
		padding, margin, etc.

CSS position:
	position: fixed; ==> sets the element to be rendered at a fixed position in the browser window
		-specify pixel values for top/bottom/left/right to specify how far from edges
	position: relative; ==> positioning relative to its neighboring sibling elements a.k.a. offset 
		from where it would be if you didn't specify a position
		-specify pixel values for top/bottom/left/right to specify how far from edges
	position: absolute; ==> sets the element to be rendered at a specific location with respect
		to its parent (first non-static parent or something like that)
		-specify pixel values for top/bottom/left/right to specify how far from edges

Homework:

1) finish command line tutorial
2) in github, create a "hw1" git repository
3) upload your assignment to that ^
4) on Lore, submit JUST THE LINK to the repository

5) see pdf thing. copy that structure and fill in the blanks
