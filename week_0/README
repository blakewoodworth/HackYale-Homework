I spent most of my time on the navigation bar at the top of the pages so i hope that if anything else is lacking that will make up for it a little bit. I also spent very little time thinking about actual content which is why all the actual words on the pages are pretty goofy/stupid so I hope the formatting and stuff makes up for that.
